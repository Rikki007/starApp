        "description": "A total lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth's umbra (the central, darkest part of its shadow) completely covers the Moon. During this event, the Moon often takes on a reddish or coppery hue, known as a 'Blood Moon.' This happens because sunlight passes through Earth's atmosphere, where shorter wavelengths (like blue) are scattered, and longer wavelengths (like red) are bent toward the Moon. Total lunar eclipses are the most striking and dramatic type, as the entire Moon is engulfed in shadow. They can last for over an hour, depending on the alignment of the Sun, Earth, and Moon. These eclipses are visible from anywhere on Earth where the Moon is above the horizon during the event and are safe to view without special equipment.",

        "description": "A partial lunar eclipse occurs when only a portion of the Moon enters the Earth's umbra, leaving the rest of the Moon illuminated by sunlight. During this event, a dark, curved shadow slowly moves across the lunar surface, creating a striking contrast between the shadowed and lit areas. The visibility of the eclipse depends on how much of the Moon enters the umbra; sometimes only a small fraction is covered, while other times nearly the entire Moon is shadowed. Partial lunar eclipses are more common than total eclipses and can be observed from any location where the Moon is visible during the event. Like all lunar eclipses, they are safe to view with the naked eye.",

        "description": "A supermoon is a captivating astronomical event that occurs when a full moon or new moon coincides with the Moon's closest approach to Earth in its elliptical orbit, known as perigee. During this time, the Moon appears larger and brighter in the sky compared to an average full moon. This happens because the Moon's distance from Earth varies between approximately 357,000 kilometers (222,000 miles) at perigee and 406,000 kilometers (252,000 miles) at its farthest point, or apogee. When the Moon is near perigee, it can appear up to 14% larger and 30% brighter than when it is at apogee",

        "description": "A penumbral lunar eclipse is the most subtle type of lunar eclipse, occurring when the Moon passes through the Earth's penumbra (the outer, lighter part of its shadow). Unlike total or partial eclipses, the Moon does not enter the dark umbra, so there is no dramatic shadow or red coloration. Instead, the Moon appears slightly dimmer, with a faint shading on one side that can be difficult to notice without careful observation. Penumbral eclipses are often mistaken for a regular full Moon, and their visibility depends on the Moon's position within the penumbra. They are the least dramatic of the three types but still offer an interesting astronomical event for those who know what to look for. Like all lunar eclipses, they are safe to view without special equipment.",
