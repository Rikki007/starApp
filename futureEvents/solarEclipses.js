Unlike total or annular eclipses, the Sun is never fully covered during a partial eclipse. This type of eclipse is visible over a broader geographic area, though the effect is less dramatic. Observers must use proper eye protection to safely view the event, as even a partially eclipsed Sun can be bright enough to cause eye damage.",

This creates a stunning 'ring of fire' effect, where the Sun's outer edges remain visible around the silhouette of the Moon. The name 'annular' comes from the Latin word annulus, meaning 'ring.' This type of eclipse happens because the Moon's apparent diameter is smaller than the Sun's, and it's a breathtaking sight for those lucky enough to witness it.",

It happens when the Moon completely blocks the Sun, casting a shadow on Earth and plunging the area within the path of totality into temporary darkness. During this brief period, the Sun's corona—its outer atmosphere—becomes visible, creating a halo of light around the Moon. Total solar eclipses are rare and fleeting, often lasting only a few minutes, but they leave a lasting impression on those who experience them.",
